This website utilizes various HTML and CSS tools with a focus on FlexBox in order to replicate a sample website landing page given by The Odin Project.

I decided to then personalize it in many ways, adding things such as iframes and image fit settings to make a page I named the DrewgAquarium.

There are links to be directed and code to be cleaned here, which I may do at a later date.

For now, Enjoy!
